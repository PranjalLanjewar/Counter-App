# Counter-App
This is a basic Counting App made by HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I applied my basic JavaScript knowledge to build it.

I learned basic syntax of JavaScript to make this app. 

I incremented and decremented the variable `count`:
- `count++` and `count--`

I made a `reset` button so that we can reset the counter to 0:
- `count=0`
